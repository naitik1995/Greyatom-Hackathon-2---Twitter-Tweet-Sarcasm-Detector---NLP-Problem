# Greyatom-Hackathon-2---Twitter-Tweet-Sarcasm-Detector---NLP-Problem
Apply NLP Techniques and Train a Model to Detect Sarcasm and Non Sarcasm in Tweets and Classify them as Sarcastic / Non Sarcastic Tweets

Twitter is a platform where people express their thoughts via tweets regarding any trending topics or regarding the topics they like. 
Nowadays, people tend to add humor or express themselves in an interesting way by adding sarcasm to the tweets. Sarcasm is to express a positive sentence in a Indirect/Negative manner that genrally tends to oppose the usual trend.

It has now become important for companies or for people to identify what the other person is trying to saw or express. Faliure in doing so can lead to misjudgement and thereby result in decisions taken that can either result in misunderstanding or loss of customer base.

Our problem here was to Train model to detect sarcastic and non sarcastic tweets so that it can predict whether the tweet posted by the user is in sarcastic / non sarcastic manner. This will enable the company to act better on the decisions and further steps to improve the customer base and make adjustements or changes or customisations for the customer based on their reviews.

We used NLP Techniques to detect and train the model on sarcastic and non sarcastic tweets.

Two notebooks have been uploaded. One of them has the preprocessing steps i.e.
Cleaning the data
Null values
Keeping only English Tweets as it accounts for 90% of the dataset records
Removing special and irrelevant characters from the Tweets
Removing @usernames from the tweets
Creating new features from the tweets

The other file has the models implemented and the combinations we tried to get some insights on how should we approach with the problem.
